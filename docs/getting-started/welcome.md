# Welcome & Introduction

## About This Documentation

This documentation is designed to help students and researchers in our Hydrometerology Lab effectively use our computing infrastructure. Whether you're an undergraduate student running your first analysis or a graduate student preparing for large-scale simulations, this guide will help you get started.

## Lab Computing Infrastructure Overview

Our lab has built a comprehensive computing infrastructure that includes:

- **Authentication System**: Centralized user management via LDAP
- **Computing Servers**: Multiple servers with GPU and CPU resources
- **Storage**: Large-scale NAS storage for datasets and user files
- **Container Registry**: Private Harbor registry for reproducible research
- **HPC Access**: Gateway to Taiwan's national HPC resources

## Who Should Use This Documentation?

### New Students
If you're new to the lab and need to learn the basics, follow the documentation in order starting from "Getting Started".

### Experienced Users
If you already know Linux and SSH, you can jump directly to specific sections like [Harbor Registry](../containers/harbor.md) or [Using SLURM](../hpc/slurm.md).

### System Maintainers
Infrastructure and administration documentation is available in the [Maintainer Documentation](../maintainer/core-server.md) section.

## Getting Help

If you need assistance:

- **Technical Issues**: Contact the lab system administrator
- **Account Problems**: Use the LDAP Account Manager web portal
- **Research Questions**: Consult with your advisor or senior lab members

## Prerequisites

To use our computing resources, you should:

- Have basic computer skills
- Be familiar with VSCode (or willing to learn)
- Have patience - learning Linux takes time, but it's worth it!
